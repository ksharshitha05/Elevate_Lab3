# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Task 3

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains **Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** completed as part of an **AI & ML Internship**.  
The objective of this task is to explore datasets, understand data patterns, analyze feature behavior, and extract meaningful insights using visualizations.

The project is implemented using **Google Colab** with an automated workflow where all outputs are saved programmatically.

## 🧠 What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing datasets to:
- Understand the structure and distribution of data
- Detect outliers and anomalies
- Identify relationships between features
- Support feature selection for machine learning models

---

## 📂 Datasets Used
1. **Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset**
   - Used for categorical data analysis
2. **Iris Dataset**
   - Used for numerical distribution, outlier detection, and correlation analysis
